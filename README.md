# Box-Plots for Education

This git hub repo hosts the winning submissions for Box-Plots for Education, a DrivenData competition.

Quoc Le won the competition using Online Learning:
>My model is based on Online Learning, specifically a Logistic Regression model that
uses the hashing trick and stochastic gradient descent with an adaptive learning rate.

Le's approach not only achieved the performance needed to win, but also has implementation benefits:
>I also recommend the Online Learning approach because
it is a simple model that is easy to code and roll out. It also has the advantage of
being “online” and incrementally updatable in a production system.  This means it
probably stands a better chance of keeping up to date with variations in how the
various text fields are recorded over time, versus a model that needs to be retrained
in batch updated in a code release.
